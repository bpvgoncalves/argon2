Description: Utilities for secure password hashing via the argon2
    algorithm.  It is a relatively new hashing algorithm and is believed
    to be very secure.  The 'argon2' implementation included in the
    package is the reference implementation.  The package also includes
    some utilities that should be useful for digest authentication,
    including a wrapper of 'blake2b'.  For similar R packages, see sodium
    and 'bcrypt'.  See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2> or
    <https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/430.pdf> for more information.
